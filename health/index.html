      <h2>The Assignment</h2>
      <p>Over the course of two weeks, we had to track everything we consumed on <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/">myfitnesspal.com</a> in order to find out what our diet looked like in comparison to a perfect healthy diet. The website tracks all of the nutrients in the foods we consume and displays them in charts, comparing them to the reccomended daily dose to show you what nutrients you are consuming too little or too much of!</p>
      <br>
      <h2>The Tracking</h2>
      <p>Tracking the food with <a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com/">myfitnesspal.com</a> was very easy to do. The two greatest difficulties I had while while tracking what I ate were:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Tracking Water</strong> was pretty difficult because I never really knew the volume of water the glasses/bottles I used were.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Being Away from Home</strong> was difficult because I wouldn't be able to track my food right away and would sometimes forget what I had eaten, although there is a mobile app for this.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <p>These weren't major challenges to overcome, and food tracking for the most part went smoothly.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>The Goals</h2>
      <p>After the first week, we were assigned to set goals based off of our current statistics on what we should work on and improve. The three goals were:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p><strong>I will increase my water intake by drinking at least the recommended 65 ounces of water every day.</strong> I was unable to meet this goal as I never really found time to refill my water bottle throughout the school day, as my classes are basically on opposite sides of the building as each other and had to rush to each one with no time to stop and refill my water bottle.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>I will increase my potassium intake by eating at least one banana every day.</strong> I was unable to meet this goal as we didn't have any bananas at home.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>I will increase my muscular strength by going to the weight room after school on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays every week.</strong> I wasn't able to meet this goal due to a dentist appointment I had on Wednesday of this week.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <h2>Eating Habits</h2>
      <p>My eating habits didn't really change as a result of this assignment. I already felt happy and healthy with the way I was already eating, and I didn't see too much a point in changing it.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Emotion</h2>
      <p>None of my eating habits were changed throughout the assignment based on emotions. I consider myself an overall well composed person and deal with any emotional problems I have without consuming everything withing a 15 meter radius.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Social and Family Influences</h2>
      <p>The biggest influence on my diet is easily my family. My parents plan and cook almost all of the meals in our household, although I do have a say in the meal plans. We usually eat relatively healthy foods while at home, but will usually take fast food while in a rush to go somewhere.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Marketing and Advertisements</h2>
      <p>There were not really any marketing strategies or advertisements that lead to me consuming something. I don't watch almost any TV, other than the occasional football game, that would have any food product advertisements in it.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Biggest Influence</h2>
      <p>As stated before, the biggest influence on what I ate was defenitely my family. They would plan all of the meals and I would just eat whatever they fed me.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Thinking of Nutrition</h2>
      <p>Over the course of the two weeks, I never really concerned myself too much with nutrition. The only time I really took it into account was the one day I made a chicken stir fry for my family, probably one of the healthiest meals we made all week. Some unhealthy foods I consumed were probably some of the school lunches I had or the snacks served at the after school robotics program.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>What I've Learned</h2>
      <p>From this assignment the biggest thing I've learned is just how much water you should be drinking on a daily basis. I didn't realize before just how little water I was really consuming. From now on, I'll probably be drinking a lot more water. Other things I've learned is just how much of certain nutrients some food had in them.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Calorie Chart</h2>
      <p>(Calorie count very low on 12/9 because I was only a small way into the day)</p>
