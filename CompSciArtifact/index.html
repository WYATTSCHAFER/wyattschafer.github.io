      <h2 class="header">So What Are They?</h2>
      <p>As the name suggests, <strong>Physics Simulations</strong> are simulations that attempt to replicate realistic physics. These simulations usually take an extremely long time to calculate and render, so a single second of the simulation could anywhere between a few minutes or multuple hours to process, depending on the scale of the simulation.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="header">What Are They Used For?</h2>
      <p><strong>Physics Simulations</strong> can be used for a multitude of real world purposes, including but not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Aerodynamics:</strong> An accurate aerodynamic simulation can help while designing new parts for planes, cars, or any other sort of object attempting to minimize drag or create lift.</li>
        <li><strong>Special Effects:</strong> Simulations could generate extremely realistic effects to replace potentially hazardous props when creating a film.</li>
        <li><strong>Mechanics:</strong> A good simulation of a machine could predict a quite few things about it, including:
          <ul>
            <li>How exactly it will function.</li>
            <li>The strain placed on it's components.</li>
            <li>Any potential errors that could occur.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Research:</strong> By simulating an environment and recreating it physically, scientists are able to test the accuracy of the math used in current physics or perhaps uncover new laws entirely!</li>
        <li><strong>A bit of good fun:</strong> No seriously, it's really cool to watch how a computer can mimic real life using only what math it was given. Add some nice shaders on it and it becomes almost impossible to tell it isn't real.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="header">Innovations</h2>
      <p>Our ability to replicate real physics is improving at a very rapid pace, with people discovering new innovative solutions to problems nearly as fast as problems arise. One of my favorite examples of a massive leap in the field was with three-way coupling, where we could accurately simulate an object floating on water due to it's surface tension, something that was nearly impossible before.

      <h2 class="header">Examples</h2>
      <p>Here's a video demonstrating the same simulation I was describing before:</p>
