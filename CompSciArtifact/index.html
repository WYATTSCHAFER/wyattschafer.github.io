      <h2 class="header">So What Are They?</h2>
      <p>As the name suggests, <strong>Physics Simulations</strong> are simulations that attempt to replicate realistic physics. These simulations usually take an extremely long time to calculate and render, so a single second of the simulation could anywhere between a few minutes or multuple hours to process, depending on the scale of the simulation.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="header">What Are They Used For?</h2>
      <p><strong>Physics Simulations</strong> can be used for a multitude of real world purposes, including but not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Aerodynamics:</strong> An accurate aerodynamic simulation can help while designing new parts for planes, racecars, or any other sort of object attempting to minimize drag or create lift.</li>
        <li><strong></strong></li>
      </ul>
