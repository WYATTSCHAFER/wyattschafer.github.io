      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Wyatt Schafer and I am a sophomore at Chippewa Falls High School. I am currently in chromebook repair 1.<br>In the future I would like to work as a software engineer. I enjoy gaming in my free time. I took the Chromebook Repair class because I have always been interested in computers and software and I wanted to learn more about computer's hardware as well. I'm hoping that by the time I leave the class, I'll have enough knowledge about the different parts of computers to build a computer of my own.</p>
