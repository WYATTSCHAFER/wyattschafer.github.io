      <h1>Chippewa Falls Teacher Interview and How Technology has a Positive Impact in the Classroom</h1>
      <p>Mrs. Merconti is a 4th-grade English teacher at Stillson Elementary. I chose her for this project because she was the first teacher I had that directly incorporated technology into my learning experience and because she was an amazing teacher. She helped me develop my interests in technology and computer software.<br>
        One of my favorite projects we completed in class was a computer programming exploration project where we used Scratch to make simple games. I had been using scratch for a while before that but never realized how hard it was to understand for some people. I was given the opportunity to teach the group of people who missed the day we went through the project. After that point, I started constantly trying to learn more and more about technology until I ended up on the high school robotics team and in the Chromebook repair class.<br>
        The classroom was always a very fun environment. We would always be doing fun and engaging activities like the previously mentioned scratch project or the time we had to write a book. We did quite a bit of our work on Chromebooks and would use printers when we had to.<br>
        Mrs. Merconti enjoys teaching in Chippewa Falls because of the amazing students and families she gets to work with. She enjoys how “our community is awesome and filled with hard-working students wanting to challenge and grow their brains.”<br>
        When asked how technology was integrated into the classroom, she responded: “Technology is integrated in our 4th grade classroom on a consistent basis.  Our students use their Chromebooks to connect with the curriculum via Google Classroom, Meets, online discussions with Padlet, editing/sharing our writing on Google Docs, making Slideshow presentations, immediate feedback with Google forms, etc.  Technology in the classrooms is HIGHLY effective in student learning and engagement.”<br>
        Her favorite lesson to teach would be creative writing. She said: “I LOVE teaching creative writing and helping students tap into their creative expression with words. I love words, and I love helping students use them as an outlet to express themselves.  Writer's Workshop is one of the favorite parts of our day.”<br>
        Some people believe that technology can be too expensive to be used effectively within schools. This is not true because, according to Drexel University School of Education, technology is also very effective in whole-class instruction and demonstrations, especially while working with visual and auditory learners.<br>
        Technology can also prepare students for their futures, as more and more parts of our society are beginning to utilize and rely on technology to function. According to Lumen Learning, “Technology is everywhere, which is why it’s important that it plays a part in students’ current learning environment. Using technology when you teach will help students to become more familiar with common programs that they will use in their future careers. Teachers aim to prepare their students, and a great way to do that is with technology. Since it will play a large role in their lives moving forward, students need to be able to understand the basics. The use of computers and the internet will be an integral part of their future professional and personal lives.”<br>
        Between their uses for students and teachers, technology has proven useful to the classroom environment in many ways, and this is only a small portion of them.<br>
